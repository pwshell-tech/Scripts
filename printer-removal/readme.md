# **Printer Removal script**

Need a quick way to remove all installed printers under a user's profile?

This little script should do the trick. 

It came about because we were changing our fleet of printers, so needed a quick way to wipe out all the printers for a user quickly. 

Hope you find it as handy as I did.
